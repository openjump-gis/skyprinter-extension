  * PrintPlugin:
    - attributeSet from printDialog() removed, to get a system print dialog
      in Windows and not the Java one. The Java one may be confused for the user
      because it shows the page size and color settings too. But in some
      environments this setting do not run. Now the user can only change the
      printer setting via the properties button in the native printer driver
      setup.

  * PrintPlugin:
